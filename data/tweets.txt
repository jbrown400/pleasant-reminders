Be yourself.
Take a deep breath.
Unclench your jaw.
Relax your shoulders.
Get some sleep.
It's okay to make mistakes.
Saying a few nice words to someone can go a long way.
It's okay to admit you were wrong.
Healing is a process.
Control what you can, work with what you can't.
Drink some water.
You’re probably luckier than you think you are.
Stop hunching over.
Cancel that one subscription you signed up for free before it charges you.
You can handle this.
You've come this far. Don't stop now... Don't ever stop.
Stay humble.
Invest in your future.
Time will pass whether you do nothing or you do something, so you might as well do something.
You are a beautiful person.
Believe in yourself.
This, too, shall pass.
Be kind.
Being human means you are subject to change and should try to adapt to it as you live.
You don’t have to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.
Short cuts make long delays.
Perfection is the enemy of good.
Slow down the speed at which you form an opinion on things you don't fully understand.
